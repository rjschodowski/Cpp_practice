/*
You have to write a function 'test' that takes two values of type double and one value of type char in its input parameters.


double test (double number1, char operate, double number2);

number1 and number2 take the values of the operands.

Operate can take +,-, *, and / in its value.

If the value of operate is +, then it should call the function that adds the values of number1 and number2 and returns the result in the output.

If the value of operate is -, then it should call the function that subtracts the value of number2 from number1 and returns the result in the output.

If the value of operate is *, then it should call the function that multiplies the values of number1 by number2 and returns the result in the output.

If the value of operate is /, then it should call the function that divides the values of number1 by number2 and returns the result in the output.

For any other value of operate, it should return -1 in the output.
