/*

You are making a program for a bus service.
A bus can transport 50 passengers at once.
Given the number of passengers waiting in the bus station as input, you need to calculate and output how many empty seats the last bus will have.

Sample Input:
126

Sample Output:
24

Explanation: The first bus will transport 50 passengers, leaving 126-50=76 in the station. The next one will leave 26 in the station, thus, the last bus will take all of the 26 passengers, having 50-26=24 seats left empty.
Hint: The modulo operator % can help to determine the number of passengers for the last bus.

/*First attempt, which failed

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
int busload = 50;
    int passengers;
    int availableSeats;
    int overflowPeople;

    //Compare # of passengers total vs a full busload (50 people)

    if (passengers <= 50) {
        //Find out # of empty seats
        availableSeats = busload - passengers;
        cout << availableSeats;
    } else if ((passengers > 50) && (50 <= 100)) {
        //Find out # of empty seats for next bus ride
        overflowPeople = passengers - busload;
        int openSeats = busload - overflowPeople;
        cout << openSeats;
    }  

    return 0;
}

I couldn't see why SoloLearn suggested using the Modulo operator. I thought I understood it, but now looking back, this exercise showed me that I didn't, and it helped
me to actually understand it better!

*/

//Here is a much better solution to find available seats, regardless of how many total passengers, great or few in number:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    //your code goes here
    int input;
    cin >> input;
    cout << 50 - input % 50;
    
    return 0;
}
