Code Challenge:

Coding exercise
You are given a grayscale image’s pixel values in a 2D array named image. The dimensions of the array are given by variables height and width.

Your task is to convert the grayscale image to a black and white image. To do this, apply a simple thresholding technique. If a pixel value is less than 7070, set it to 00, otherwise set it to 255255.

Before diving directly into code, try to think about how you would use loops and array operations to do this. We won’t check if your code is correct or not. If you get stuck, you can always see the given solution in a laater lesson

Good Luck! 👍

📝 Note: You don’t need to worry about the details of imagelib.h. Just use height and width parameters to traverse the 2D-array.

#include <iostream>
#include "imagelib.h"

int main() {
  // Displays input image
  loadFile("input.png");
  // Traverse rows in 2D array
  for (int i = 0; i < height; i++) {
    // Traverse columns in each row
    for (int j = 0; j < width; j++) {
      // Process pixel image[i][j], here
      if (image[i][j] < 70) {
        // Sets image pixel to black
        image[i][j] = 0;
      } else {
        // Sets image pixel to white
        image[i][j] = 255;
      }
    }
  }
  // Displays modified image
  saveFile("output/modified.png");
}
