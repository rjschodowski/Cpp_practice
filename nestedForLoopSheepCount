/*
Objective
Have you ever had a tough time going to sleep? Have you tried counting sheep? We will make a program that will count sheep for you.

Begin by creating an integer variable to hold the number of sheep. Ask the user how many sheep do they need to count before falling asleep (choose between 1-500). Have the user ‘cin’ the number of sheep into your variable. Create a for loop that has an iterator that starts at 1. Add a condition that your variable has to be less than or equal the number of sheep your user wants. Have your iterator be updated by adding 1 every time the loop is ran. Inside your for loop, ‘cout’ the amount of sheep that have been counted, use your iterator to show this. Ex: “You have counted # sheep” Outside of your loop ‘cout’ a message you want your user to see before they go to sleep.

#include <iostream>
using std::cout;
using std::cin;
using std::endl;

int main() {
  int sheep, i, z;
  cout << "How many sheep do you need to count before falling asleep?" << endl;
  cin >> sheep;

  for (i =1; i<=sheep; i++) {
    cout << "\nYou counted " << i << " sheep...\n" << endl;
    for (z =0; z< 3; z++) {
      cout << "\tSnawshoo...Snawshoo...Snawshoo..." << endl;
    };
  }
  cout << "\nGood night and sleep tight!" << endl;
}

//I wanted to add a snoring nested for loop!
