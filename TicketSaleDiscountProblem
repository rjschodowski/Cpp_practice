/*You are working on a ticketing system. A ticket costs $10.
The office is running a discount campaign: each group of 5 people is getting a discount, which is determined by the age of the youngest person in the group.
You need to create a program that takes the ages of all 5 people as input and outputs the total price of the tickets.

Sample Input:
55
28
15
38
63

Sample Output:
42.5

The youngest age is 15, so the group gets a 15% discount from the total price, which is $50 - 15% = $42.5

        age = ages[i];

    cout << 50 - (50 * age/100);
