/*

Write a program that asks for two words

If one word is longer than the other, write 'This word is longer'
If one words is shorter than the other, write 'This word is shorter'
or,
If both words are the same length, write 'Both are the same length.'

Hint: use Guess My Number program for ideas
You are comparing the lengths of each string

//I know this is really basic, but this is quite fun! I like the ease of writing strings as opposed to writing strings in C. (No offense, C!)
